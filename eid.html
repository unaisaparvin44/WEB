<h1><u>Eid al-Fitr</u></h1>
<img src="file:///home/mca/Desktop/eid.jpeg">
<p>Eid al-Fitr has a particular salah that consists of two rakats generally performed in an open field or large hall. It may only be performed in congregation (jamāʿat) and features seven additional Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears whilst reciting the Takbir, saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar", meaning "God is the greatest"). In the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, there are three Takbirs at the start of the first rakat and three just before rukūʿ in the second rakat.[7] Other Sunni schools usually have 12 Takbirs, similarly split in groups of seven and five. In Shia Islam, the salat has six Takbirs in the first rakat at the end of Tilawa, before rukūʿ, and five in the second.[8] Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this salat is either farḍ (فرض, obligatory) or mustaḥabb (strongly recommended).</p>
